# Design System: PAL

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
A premium, trustworthy, and modern Korean fitness aesthetic with clean lines, generous whitespace, and a professional feel. The overall atmosphere is light, clean, and motivating, with subtle gradients adding a touch of premium quality.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Clean White** (#FFFFFF) – Primary background for main content sections.
- **Soft Gray** (#F8FAFC) – Alternating background for sections to provide visual separation.
- **Vibrant Blue** (#2563EB) – Primary accent color for Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons, links, and highlights. Conveys trust and dynamism.
- **Fresh Green** (#10B981) – Secondary accent color for success states, checkmarks, and positive feedback.
- **Text Primary (Near Black)** (#111827) – Dominant color for headings and important text, ensuring high readability.
- **Text Secondary (Slate Gray)** (#64748B) – Used for body text and descriptive content, providing good contrast without being overly harsh.
- **Dark Background (Footer)** (#1E293B) – Used for the footer section, providing a strong visual anchor and contrast with light text.

## 3. Typography Rules
A clean sans-serif font (Inter or system font equivalent) with Korean support. Headings utilize a heavier weight for emphasis, while body text uses a regular weight for readability. Generous line-heights and letter-spacing contribute to a breathable and professional look.

## 4. Component Stylings
*   **Buttons:** Rounded corners (12px radius), with a vibrant blue primary color for CTAs. They feature a subtle hover elevation and soft shadow for interactivity and depth. Outlined buttons are used for secondary actions.
*   **Cards/Containers:** Soft rounded corners (16px radius), light shadow, and a subtle hover lift effect to indicate interactivity and emphasize content. Used for feature descriptions, pricing plans, and testimonials.
*   **Inputs/Forms:** (Not explicitly defined in prompt, assuming standard clean aesthetic)

## 5. Layout Principles
Generous padding (64px for sections) and ample whitespace are used throughout to create a clean, breathable, and uncluttered layout. Content is well-organized with clear visual hierarchy. Sections are designed to be fully responsive, adapting from desktop-first to tablet (single column below 768px) and mobile (vertical stacking, full-width buttons).
